# NyanLang Ecosystem üê±

Welcome to the official repository for the NyanLang language ecosystem! This repository is the home for the Nyan programming language, its reference compiler, standard library, and other tooling.

Nyan is a statically-typed, minimalistic programming language designed with simplicity, readability, and eventual performance in mind.

*(P.S. I have no icon for the language yet. If you have a good idea, please let me know! üê± is a temporary marker.)*

## üß≠ The NyanLang Ecosystem

This repository is structured as a monorepo containing all official components of the NyanLang project.

| Component | Directory | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reference Compiler** | [`./claw-compiler/`](./claw-compiler/) |  In Progress | The reference implementation of the Nyan compiler. |
| **Language Specification** | [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](./claw-compiler/docs/SPECIFICATION.md) | In Progress | The formal specification for Nyan syntax and semantics. |
| **Standard Library** | `(Planned)` | Not Started | The future home of Nyan's standard library (`std`). |
| **Tooling** | `(Planned)` | Not Started | Future plans include a language server, formatter, etc. |

## üó∫Ô∏è High-Level Roadmap

My primary goal is to bring the Nyan language to life through a phased approach:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Implementation (In Progress)**
    * Develop a feature-complete reference compiler/interpreter (`claw-compiler`).
    * Formalize the language specification.

2.  **Phase 2: Standard Library**
    * Design and implement a useful standard library.

3.  **Phase 3: Tooling & Ecosystem**
    * Develop developer tools like a language server (LSP), package manager, and code formatter.

## ü§ù Contributing

This is an open-source project driven by passion. Contributions of any kind are incredibly welcome! Whether it's code, documentation, language design ideas, or bug reports, your input is valuable.
